Solving nonlinear equations. 
Task: Find the smallest positive root of the nonlinear equation x^4 − 5.74x^3 + 8.18x − 3.48 = 0 by the relaxation method, the modified Newton method, and the simple iteration method with an accuracy of ε = 10^(−4). Find the a priori and a posteriori estimate of the number of steps. Choose the same initial interval and initial approximation for both methods (if possible), compare the results of the methods.
